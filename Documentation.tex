\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Objective}
One of our current projects is in establishing a pipeline for the analysis of data obtained from multiple sources (e.g. DNA and RNA sequencing, proteome) relating to a plant and its associated microbiome. Our objective is to develop a user-friendly web application to visualise the microbiome data. This could include (but not limited to) a GUI friendly front-page where the user can interact with the image of a plant through interaction the user can dive more into various microbe/microbiome information generated from data analysis relating to species/tissue. As for the back-end, user will be able to search specific project-related data, download certain files, and make comparison between different data set at different level.  In addition, integration of existing visualisation bioinformatics tools such as genome browsers/Krona/plotly/D3/Phinch/blast/interactive pathway explorer will be expected as well as the ability to search the data (Back-end).

\section{Project Scope}
The MicroPortal project was initiated by Amali Thrimawithana as part of the Discovery Science project, an initial web application prototype was developed by the students at AUT (prototype available upon request). After the prototype was established, the team saw the potential and decided to push the MicroPortal project further, to a user friendly and interactive web application product with extensive features to satisfy researcher's expectation on related projects. The team recruited Jack Wang (MInfoTech, BSc in Compsci at UoA) to finish the task.
\newline
The project started on late November, after the initial meeting on user requirement, we determined the development cycle and priorities. Overall, the project development contents were separated into front-end \& back-end. Apart of the coding process, design \& consulting with the team in advance, quality assurance \& feedback after certain feature accomplished are strictly followed during the development cycle.  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Design Principle
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Acquire necessary information and requirement from the team/researchers in advance
        \item Maximizing the user-friendliness, interactivity and intuition of the web application 
        \item Building core functions required by researchers
        \item Any additional features can be embedded into current framework seamlessly
        \item The application should be portable and accessible for future development  
    \end{itemize}
  \item Front-end 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Establishing a home page, integrating multiple projects and their brief introduction.
        \item Diversity view page development 
        \item Comparison function for certain project
        \item About page contains project details
        \item Search result page for presenting project data, also in associate with back-end database
    \end{itemize}
  \item Back-end
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Establishing a project specified database on powerplant
        \item Apache HTTP server required (supported by powerplant) 
        \item Comparison function fetch the data from database
        \item Download function available on certain FASTA files
        \item External link/culture color labels on search result. 
    \end{itemize}
  \item QA \& Feedback
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Manual test on certain new features, fixing then re-test  
        \item Update new features to the team, waiting for feedback
        \item Collecting and analyse feedback 
        \item Fixing and improving
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

           \item Auckland
           \item Bay of Plenty
           \item Manawatu-Wanganui
           \item Otago
           \item Southland
       \end{itemize}
       \begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=7.5cm,height=5cm]{HLAuckland.PNG}

        Same operation mode as introduced in previous section. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

{\Large \item Comparison} (\textcolor{blue}{Comparison.html} \& \textcolor{blue}{Culture_Comparison.html})
\newline
\newline
MicroPortal can not only display project information and microbe data visualisation, but also offers customized project data comparison at different levels. The comparison function for Discovery Science project is implemented, and we want this function to be more flexible, portable and extensible, as we intend to integrate the comparison function into future projects. The following two pages are Discovery Science Comparison Guide at metagenomic - contig level and culture level. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{large}\textbf{Metagenomic - Contig Level Comparison }\end{large}(\textcolor{blue}{Comparison.html})
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Anychart.js}
    \newline
    All the comparison Venn diagrams and pie charts are generated using Anychart.js (trial version), it is a open source chart generation tool without license requirement. For details, please visit:
    \newline
    \url{https://www.anychart.com/}
    \item \textbf{Data Input}
    \newline
    Most diagram/charts are automatically generated using the data from Powerplant db server where all the project related data are stored. 
    Due to the limitation of Anychart.js, some of the input data were manually imported for the purpose of accuracy. For the future development, we are seeking ways to fully automate the process with high accuracy (data crawling algorithm combine with scalable chart generation tools, pipeline etc.)
    \newline
    \item \textbf{User Guide}
    \newline
    For both metagenomic - contig level \& culture comparisons, user can compare up to three tissue type with selective compare type. As the Venn diagram displayed on the right side, user can see the tissue name with amount of value under it. User can mouse hover on each Venn diagram section to browse Species/Genus/Family/Culture information, then click each section to view the data proportion pie chart which contains amount and percent value.
    \begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=13cm,height=7.5cm]{Comparison.PNG}
    \caption{Metagenomic Comparison}
    \label{fig:Start Tour}
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\item \begin{large}\textbf{Culture Level Comparison }\end{large}(\textcolor{blue}{Culture Comparison.html})
\newline
\newline
Culture comparison has the same functionality as metagenomic comparison, it uses culture data to compare each tissue. 
\end{itemize}
   

\end{enumerate}

\section{Application Back-end Guide}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\Large Database}
\newline
\newline
We deployed our database on Powerplant Database Server:
\newline
\url{https://powerplant.pfr.co.nz/dbaas/}
\newline For Discovery Science project, we set up a database to store all the project-related data. The structure we use is relational database MySQL. In the future, we might switch to NoSQL DBMSs for its light weight structure, quick access to massive datasets.
\newline
For developer to access the database, they will be required to have authorization on DB username: \textcolor{blue}{hraaxt\_microbiom}, the database name is \textcolor{blue}{hraaxt\_microPortal} and the table name:  \textcolor{blue}{DS_Data}. More information is available in the code file   \textcolor{blue}{Search.php}.
\item {\Large Powerplant Server}
\newline
\newline
In order to establish MicroPortal access for all PFR stuff in a portable and easy way, we deployed the web application on Powerplant development server \textcolor{blue}{aklppf13}, under the directory:  \textcolor{blue}{/var/www/html/microPortal}, all the web application updates should go through this route.  
\item {\Large Search Page} (\textcolor{blue}{Search.php} \& \textcolor{blue}{Precise_Search.php})
\newline
\newline
The search engine is powered by .php and MySQL database. User can search for any key word in the project datasets. In the case of Discovery Science, the main searchable terms include taxon/contig ID, taxonomy name for species, genus and family. The average time for searching is between 2-3 seconds. The search bar is placed on the top-right of Discovery Science Diversity View page, and other DS related pages (comparison etc.). Note that this database is specific established for DS project, and the data is not applied on other projects (Honey Landscape etc.). 
\newline
\newline
Due to the massive datasets and large amount of duplicated information (only contig ids are unique), we set up a precise search function to let user searches up to five criteria, in order to display user's expected search results.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm,height=1.5cm]{PreciseSearch.PNG}
    \caption{Precise Search Function}
    \label{fig:Start Tour}
\end{figure}
\newline
The search page is also include download function, user can simply click the Contig ID to download the corresponding FASTA file.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5cm,height=2cm]{FastaDownload.PNG}
    \caption{FASTA Download}
    \label{fig:Start Tour}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm,height=3cm]{FastaFile.PNG}
    \caption{FASTA file}
    \label{fig:Start Tour}
\end{figure}
\newline
\newline
\newline
In addition, for scientific purpose, we colorized the genus type under three conditions: genomic support, culturing support, and both genomic \& culturing support. The colors are outlined as white, yellow and green.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=8cm,height=1.5cm]{ColorGenus.PNG}
    \caption{Colorized Genus}
    \label{fig:Start Tour}
\end{figure}
\newline
In the search results, user can identify the category of genus by its background color. As the screen capture shows below, the same genus under different tissues would have different support from genomic/culturing.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm,height=4.5cm]{GenusTable.PNG}
    \caption{Search Table Demo}
    \label{fig:Start Tour}
\end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Summary \& Future Development}
During the first four months development period, the MicroPortal framework has been successfully established as a functional product and microbe data visualisation tool. Currently, two projects: Discovery Science \& Honey Landscape had been integrated in the framework. And with the deployment on Powerplant server, PFR stuffs can take a look and provide valuable feedback.

For the future development and maintenance, we plan to bring more PFR projects into this framework, the projects will not limited to microbe or specific types. And we will provide more functions to satisfy scientific requirements. We will have discussion with the scientists who showed interests and happy to display their project data on the web application. For start, the original home page had been modified to be able to fit more projects in a user friendly way, and we are open to any feedback and suggestion. Feel free to contact Jack Wang (\href{mailto:Jack.Wang@plantandfood.co.nz}{Jack.Wang@plantandfood.co.nz}) and Amali Thrimawithana (\href{Amali.Thrimawithana@plantandfood.co.nz}{Amali.Thrimawithana@plantandfood.co.nz}) for any questions.
